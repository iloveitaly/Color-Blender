Color Blender is a Cocoa application that was created because I got tired of finding hex/rgb values for colors and finding colors in Apple's default color picker that corresponded with hex/rgb values. It is also very helpful when coming up with a color scheme for a web-site or design to blend two colors together to try to find a matching color for your color scheme. As seen in the screen shot below you can blend two colors together and find the hex & rgb values for all the three colors.

In addition, you can edit the rgb & hex values for the colors. Through the preferences pane you can customize a prefix to be added to the hex values. You can easily copy hex/rgb values through the dock menu (as seen on the right), allowing quick access while using other applications such as Photoshop or Flash.
